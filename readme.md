This project requires on large amounts of data that I will not be including in the repository. 
If you intend to build the following project for your own uses, know that the data I used is accessible 
at the following locations:

1. ARXIV Corpus Metadata: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/Cornell-University/arxiv?resource=download
2. PubMed Diabetes Dataset: https://linqs.org/datasets/#pubmed-diabetes
