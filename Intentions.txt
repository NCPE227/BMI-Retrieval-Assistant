1. Create a graph db that has nodes based on common terminology in data
2. Nodes should be connected to standard medical ontologies. I am familiar with Disease Ontology and ICD-11 APIs so lets use those.
3. LLM Frontend should be able to reach out to the graph db and query based on keywords included. It should return some recent papers regarding terms in the query.
4. Keywords ideally could be pulled on non-medical data too to include technologies that might be used in the field.

Overview:
Graph DB where nodes are common terms across the corpus included in my database. These nodes will be matched with condition codes in
disease ontology and ICD-11. Additionally, a corpus of papers will be included so that additional expanding information can be included.

The LLM should be able to respond with 3 papers relating to the query as they are tied to the nodes being queried. We do this via a
similarity search.
